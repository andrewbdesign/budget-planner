## About

This project is about saving money

### Starting the project

This project uses nodejs for the backend and mongodb for the database. In order to setup the backend, you will need to make sure that you have the following:

- node 10.16.0
- npm 6.9.0

## Development server

Open terminal and navigate to root project:

```
npm run dev:server
```

This will use nodemon and restart the server if any backend changes are detected.

## Frontend client

In another terminal window, navigate to the root of the project, simply run:

```
npm run client
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## Deploy
